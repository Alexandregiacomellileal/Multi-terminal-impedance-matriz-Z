This paper presents the experimental identification of a multi-terminal impedance matrix Z for the grounding system of a distribution tower with four concrete
foundations and four counterpoise cables. The approach combines field measurements with clamp-on ground meters (passive and active methods), individual
current measurements in each leg and in each counterpoise, and a low-frequency multi-terminal network model. The impedance matrix Z is obtained by least
squares from 16 test configurations and is validated both against the equivalent tower resistance and against the current distribution among electrodes, in line
with previous works on tower grounding impedance measurement and modeling. A current–to–potential transfer matrix T is identified for five buried potential sensors, and a data-driven estimator of tower grounding resistance Rtower is derived using a linear combination of local potentials and counterpoise currents. Finally, we propose health indices based on Z and T that can be implemented in an edge device for online condition monitoring and localisation of degraded electrodes.
